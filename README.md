# polyomino-searcher

This is a very slow brute force method for finding polyominoes

To intall this application, run

```git clone https://github.com/just-another-guy-with-a-username/polyomino-searcher.git```

To get into the directory, run

```cd polyominoes```

To run the application, run

```python main.py n n2```

or

```python3 main.py n n2```

where n is the number of squares you want to the polyomino to have and n2 is the number of polyominoes you want to present in a row (both default to 4).

This program becomes very slow past n = 8, and it can use a lot of memory depending on how big your number is, be aware of that.
